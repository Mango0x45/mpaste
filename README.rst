mpaste
======

**mpaste** is a super minimal paste server written in Go. It supports extremely simple file uploads
assuming you have the tools available to do so, such as ``curl(1)``. It also supports viewing pastes
in the browser as either raw text or with syntax highlighting. This paste server has no web
interface for adding pastes, no stupid moving parts, no useless garbage.
